When using Yomoni bank, wrongpass has no message
"Custom implementations that include transmission of user credentials (login or password) require the Agent Status. The wrongpass state cannot be handled if you don't hold this status."
	What is Agent Status?

WHY TF wrongpass is not a connection return and it has a variable number of fields???

How to force "bug" connection state? setting it in "openapiwebsite" doesn't seem to do anything...

No FormField documentation found
